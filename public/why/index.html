			<h3>A Local Gem</h3>

			<img src="/images/courtyard.jpg" class="coreImage" />

			<p><p>North Shore Elementary has been proudly serving students for over 90 years and is the alma mater to many of today’s leaders in St. Petersburg.  It is a small school with character, compassion, diversity, and ingenuity that continues to define what successful public education should and can look like.  With approximately 350 students, the small size of North Shore allows for all teachers and staff to know all students, not just the ones in their classes.  Whether you are walking around the campus, participating in school-wide events, or at the monthly assemblies you can see and hear teachers, students, and parents supporting each other and engaging in each other’s lives.  Additionally, the teachers who come to North Shore Elementary to teach stay there, and are continually supported to grow and develop their craft as they see fit.</p>

			<h3>Community</h3>
			

			<img src="/images/kindergarden.png" class="coreImage" height="600px;" />

			<p><p>There is something incredibly rewarding about sending your child to the school next door. Friends, activites and events are nearby. You see the same faces, and grow to care for and respect your neighbors. Coincidentally, this has created an incredibly active group of parents and community members making up both the <a href="#">Parent and Teacher Association</a> (PTA) and <a href="#">School Advisory Committee</a> (SAC) who continue to support and challenge the school to be the best it can be.</p>

			<h3>About Friends</h3>

			<img src="/images/KidsBanner.jpg" class="coreImage" />

			<p><p>Friends of North Shore Elementary (FNSE) was founded from sidewalk conversations in 2015. Neighbors with preschool aged children were asking themselves,&ldquo;Why are families in one neighborhood attending over 10 different elementary schools instead of North Shore Elementary, our zoned school?&rdquo; The interest in this idea was incredibly strong, and it was clear that many individuals wanted to support their neighborhood school. With the purpose to help bring positive focus and contribution to North Shore Elementary, FNSE incorporated as a non-profit in December 2015 and was established as a 501&copy;(3) a few months later.</p>
