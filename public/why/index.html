			<p><p>North Shore Elementary has been proudly serving students for over 90 years and is the alma mater to many of today’s leaders in St. Petersburg.  It is a small school with character, compassion, diversity, and ingenuity that continues to define what successful public education should and can look like.  With approximately 350 students, the small size of North Shore allows for all teachers and staff to know all students, not just the ones in their classes.  Whether you are walking around the campus, participating in school-wide events, or at the monthly assemblies you can see and hear teachers, students, and parents supporting each other and engaging in each other’s lives.  Additionally, the teachers who come to North Shore Elementary to teach stay there, and are continually supported to grow and develop their craft as they see fit.</p>

			<p><p>There is something incredibly rewarding about sending your child to the school next door. Friends, activites and events are nearby. You see the same faces, and grow to care for and respect your neighbors. Coincidentally, this has created an incredibly active group of parents and community members making up both the <a href="/nse#ParentTeacherAssociation">Parent and Teacher Association</a> (PTA) and <a href="/nse#7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;Hour">School Advisory Committee</a> (SAC) who continue to support and challenge the school to be the best it can be.</p>

			<p><p><a href="https://www.pcsb.org/domain/2019">Principle Cooper Dawson</a> has been a principal in the Pinellas County School system since 2005 and spent the prior 10 years in the classroom.  She holds a Master’s Degree in Education from the University of South Florida, and brings with her a wealth of experience and knowledge.  She has created a caring a nurturing environment, motivating staff and students to work as a community alway in the pursuit of excellence.  She continues to make great strides in re-establishing North Shore Elementary as a dynamic, engaging, and successful school. Additionally, she welcomes further education for teachers, and the inclusion of alternate programs like <a href="/nse#CastleApprenticeship">C.A.P</a>, a project based approach.</p>

		<h3 class="">The School Grade</h3>



		<p class="desc">Florida School Accountability Reports currently <a href="http://www.fldoe.org/accountability/accountability-reporting/school-grades/">grades North Shore Elementary as a <b>B</b></a>. While the staff should be proud of the increase from last year, we want to caution parents that the school grade is not a sufficient enough measure alone. North Shore proudly maintains a robust ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) program. They have approximately one unit (or class) per grade made up of students that qualify for ASD services.  These students are all tested the same as the rest of the student body.  Being a small school and having 12% of our student population qualifying as ASD students can and does impact our school grade.</p>

		<ul>
			
		</ul>

		<p><img src="/images/SchoolGrade.png" style="margin: 75px auto; display: block; border-radius: 4px; max-width:100%;"/></p>

<p>At the same time, the school grade is not all that prospective parents should care about. Gearing specifically towards tests does not ensure a well rounded education. <a href="#">Homework policies</a>, <a href="#">teacher engagement</a>, <a href="#">recess time</a> and many other factors go into the North Shore experience. We strongly encourage all families who are considering North Shore elementary to <a href="#">schedule a tour</a> and see first hand if the school meets their needs. Molly / Marci, are these two paragraphs the right feel? Discuss where we want to go with this.</p>

			<p><p>Friends of North Shore Elementary (FNSE) was founded from sidewalk conversations in 2015. Neighbors with preschool aged children were asking themselves,&ldquo;Why are families in one neighborhood attending over 10 different elementary schools instead of North Shore Elementary, our zoned school?&rdquo; The interest in this idea was incredibly strong, and it was clear that many individuals wanted to support their neighborhood school. With the purpose to help bring positive focus and contribution to North Shore Elementary, FNSE incorporated as a non-profit in December 2015 and was established as a 501&copy;(3) a few months later.</p>
