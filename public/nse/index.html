			<p><p>Originally established as Coffee Pot Elementary in 1927, North Shore Elementary and has been proudly serving students for nearly 90 years. With <a href="#">small class sizes</a>, <a href="#">a great staff</a>, active community involvement and a <a href="/why">B school rating</a>, North Shore Elementary continues to improve and impress. We encourage all parents to see what North Shore has to offer its community and your family by scheduling a school tour today. Tours are given by Ms. Gervais, and scheduled as needed. Please <a href="gervaisv@pcsb.org">email Ms. Gervais</a> or call 727-893-2181 and ask for her by name. You may also find relevant information on the <a href="https://www.pcsb.org/northshore-es">North Shore Elementary site</a> or on their <a href="https://twitter.com/NorthShoreElem">Twitter feed</a>. A few of the unique experiences North Shore Elementary has to offer are listed below.</p>

		<p class="desc">The PTA’s vision is to foster a fully inclusive school community where students are thriving, teachers are supported, families are engaged, and all voices are welcome. Attending a PTA meeting, which take place every other month, is an easy way to get connected to the school community. Additionally, there are a number of committee to get involved in including Fall Festival, Turkey Trot, Educational Garden, and Families Socials to name a few.</p>

			<p><p>At North Shore Elementary, they have realized that not everything they want included in a school day fits into the 6 hour schedule.  Therefore, they have worked hard to bring in programming as part of the “7th Hour”, or <a href="https://www.pcsb.org/domain/8833">before and after-school enrichment programs</a>. Some programs are free (costs covered by PTA), and some are fee for service with scholarships available for families.  The goal of the 7th hour is to enrich the students school day in a way that is accessible to all families and benefiting the entire North Shore Elementary community. Currently, there are 13 after school opportunities:</p>

			<p><p>C.A.P. is the acronym for the Castle Apprenticeship Program, previously called the “Schoolwide Enrichment Model” (SEM) that North Shore Elementary piloted in 2016. CAP is a <a href="https://gifted.uconn.edu/semr-about2/">research-based program out of the University of Connecticut</a> that focuses on giving every child exposure to gifted curriculum and project based learning. This is an opportunity for all students to explore an area of interest in a nontraditional setting. CAP is traditionally experienced as an 8-week session.  Every Wednesday from 845AM – 945AM students report to a “cluster” that they have chosen based on their personal interests. Throughout this 8-week session, each cluster works on creating a final product that they will showcase for parents and families at the end of the session. Previous projects include:</p>

			<p><p>Currently North Shore Elementary has 53 students enrolled in its gifted program and houses a full-time gifted Teacher.  Students in the gifted program meet daily with the other students in their grade level and the gifted teacher and engage with an innovative project-based learning gifted curriculum. Unlike many other schools North Shore screens all incoming Kindergarteners for the gifted program, and then has identified students tested by the district.  By doing this the school eliminates teacher and parent bias when testing for the gifted program and is better able to serve all students.</p>
