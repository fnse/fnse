      <description>North Shore Elementary has realized that not everything you want included in a school day fits into the 6 hour schedule. Therefore, the school has worked hard to bring in programming as part of the “7th Hour”, or before and after-school enrichment programs. Some programs are free to families (costs covered by PTA), and some are fee for service with scholarships available for families in need. The goal of the 7th hour is to enrich the students school day in a way that is accessible to all families and benefiting the entire North Shore Elementary community.</description>

It is a small school with character, compassion, diversity, and ingenuity that continues to define what successful public education should and can look like.

      <description>Friends of North Shore Elementary (FNSE) was founded from sidewalk conversations in 2015. Neighbors with preschool aged children were asking themselves, &amp;ldquo;Why are families in one neighborhood attending over 10 different elementary schools instead of North Shore Elementary, our zoned school?&amp;rdquo; The interest in this idea was incredibly strong, and it was clear that many individuals wanted to support their neighborhood school. With the purpose to help bring positive focus and contribution to North Shore Elementary, FNSE incorporated as a non-profit in December 2015 and was established as a 501&amp;#40;c)(3) a few months later.</description>

      <description>C.A.P. is the acronym for the Castle Apprenticeship Program, previously called the “Schoolwide Enrichment Model” (SEM) that North Shore Elementary piloted in 2016. CAP is a research-based program out of the University of Connecticut that focuses on giving every child exposure to project based learning. This is an opportunity for all students to explore an area of interest in a nontraditional setting. CAP is traditionally experienced as an 8-week session. Every Wednesday morning students report to a “cluster” that they have chosen based on their personal interests.</description>

      <description>There is something incredibly rewarding about sending your child to the school next door. Friends, activites and events are nearby. You see the same faces, and grow to care for and respect your neighbors. Coincidentally, this has created an incredibly active group of parents and community members making up both the Parent and Teacher Association (PTA) and School Advisory Committee (SAC) who continue to support and challenge the school to be the best it can be.</description>

      <description>Currently North Shore Elementary has approximately 15% of its students enrolled in its gifted program and houses a full-time gifted Teacher. Students in the gifted program meet daily with the other students in their grade level and the gifted teacher and engage with an innovative project-based learning gifted curriculum. Unlike many other schools, North Shore screens all incoming Kindergarteners for the gifted program, and then has identified students tested by the district.</description>

      <description>The school grade cannot be all that prospective parents should care about. It is our belief that gearing specifically towards tests does not ensure a well rounded education for our kids. Homework policies, teacher engagement, recess time, after-school enrichments, and many other factors go into the North Shore experience. We strongly encourage all families who are considering North Shore elementary to schedule a tour and see first hand how NSE meets the needs of all students.</description>
