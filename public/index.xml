      <description>Friends of North Shore Elementary (FNSE) was founded from sidewalk conversations in 2015. Neighbors with preschool aged children were asking themselves,&amp;ldquo;Why are families in one neighborhood attending over 10 different elementary schools instead of North Shore Elementary, our zoned school?&amp;rdquo; The interest in this idea was incredibly strong, and it was clear that many individuals wanted to support their neighborhood school. With the purpose to help bring positive focus and contribution to North Shore Elementary, FNSE incorporated as a non-profit in December 2015 and was established as a 501&amp;copy;(3) a few months later.</description>

      <description>North Shore Elementary is a red brick school shaded by century-old oak trees, located at the north end of Coffee Pot Bayou in a quiet residential setting. It is rich in history and tradition but also is moving forward to prepare its students for the future.
