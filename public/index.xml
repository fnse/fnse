      <description>North Shore Elementary opened in 1927 as Coffee Pot Elementary and has all of the original buildings plus a few new ones and a few portables. In recent years, attention has come for the need to 1) Update areas of North Shore’s campus, 2) To allow our school pride to show with better views from 1st Street and 34th Avenue, and 3) To plan for growth. North Shore Elementary completed the first phase of a campus renovation in the summer of 2017 in which the school entrance (on 35th Avenue NE), front office, main hallway and the fireplace room were renovated.</description>

      <description>The instances in which students are referred for excessive behavior or discipline problems in virtually nonexistent at North Shore Elementary. Our school expectations are embedded in our Guidelines for Success that form the acronym KNIGHTS (Keep Trying, Nurture our environment, Inspire cooperation, Give our best effort, Have respect, Take responsibility, Support fellow Knights). Our Guidelines for Success help teachers align their classroom rules with the school‐wide Positive Behavior System (PBS) and expectations.</description>

      <description>Currently North Shore Elementary has 53 students enrolled in its gifted program and houses a full-time gifted Teacher. Students in the gifted program meet daily with the other students in their grade level and the gifted teacher and engage with an innovative project-based learning gifted curriculum. Unlike many other schools North Shore screens all incoming Kindergarteners for the gifted program, and then has identified students tested by the district. By doing this the school eliminates teacher and parent bias when testing for the gifted program and is better able to serve all students.</description>

      <title>How does testing impact students school day and school experience?</title>

      <guid>/questions/nse/how-does-testing-impact-students-school-day-and-school-experience-/</guid>
      <description>We all know there is a reputation of testing overwhelming public schools and teachers, and taking away from creative learning. There is a perception that in public schools all teachers do is teach to a test and that students are tested all the time. At North Shore we do use dand assessments to help measure student learning but we do not let it define us. All students in grades 1-5 take a MAP Assessment for in ELA (Language Arts) and Math three times a year (Fall, Winter, Spring).</description>

      <title>What does Homework look like at North Shore?</title>

      <guid>/questions/nse/what-does-homework-look-like-at-north-shore-/</guid>
      <description>North Shore believes in its teachers, and that they know how their students will learn and experience school best. As such, homework is a teacher-by-teacher choice. Some classrooms (most K classes) have a monthly packet that goes home with various activities to work through with your student as home time allows. Some classrooms have a weekly packet, while some other classrooms have no homework at all. There is not a top-down one size fits all approach to homework at North Shore.</description>

      <description>Seeing and understanding the value of learning other languages, parents and administration have been working together to provide foreign language options for students. Currently, foreign language is not included in the regular day at North Shore, but Spanish is an option for an after-school enrichment once a week (see Question #10 for more information).</description>

      <title>Beyond state standards, how are teachers engaging their students?</title>

      <guid>/questions/nse/beyond-state-standards--how-are-teachers-engaging-their-students-/</guid>
      <description>North Shore’s principal, Ms. Cooper Dawson, is passionate about student engagement and student learning. It is a priority at North Shore for teachers to understand what each of their students’ learning needs are and to ensure they are being met. While students work together through the day, they also “cluster” by ability and do individual work as well. The philosophy of Pinellas County Schools is that the only way for all kids to achieve success is to challenge and raise expectations on all students, not just a few.</description>

      <description>The school grades are based purely on one standardized test given by the state each spring. In elementary school only scores from 3rd, 4th and 5th graders are included in the school grade. There are eight “components” to the elementary school grade. Four of those components are the average of scores in: 1) English Language Arts, 2) Mathematics, 3) Science and 4) Social Studies. The other four components are an expression of learning gains.</description>

      <description>At North Shore Elementary, they have realized that not everything they want included in a school day fits into the 6 hour schedule. Therefore, they have worked hard to bring in programming as part of the “7th Hour”, or before and after-school enrichment programs. Some programs are free (costs covered by PTA), and some are fee for service with scholarships available for families. The goal of the 7th hour is to enrich the students school day in a way that is accessible to all families and benefiting the entire North Shore Elementary community.</description>

      <description>There has already been noticable progress with the implementation of programs like 7th Hour and opportunities for exceptional students. Not to mention, a ton of cool things are happening around campus. Then, add in physical upgrades to the campus, boosting classrooms, and continued learning for teachers and it becomes easy to see how much potential North Shore Elementary has in the coming years.</description>

      <description>Friends of North Shore Elementary (FNSE) was founded from sidewalk conversations in 2015. Neighbors with preschool aged children were asking themselves,&amp;ldquo;Why are families in one neighborhood attending over 10 different elementary schools instead of North Shore Elementary, our zoned school?&amp;rdquo; The interest in this idea was incredibly strong, and it was clear that many individuals wanted to support their neighborhood school. With the purpose to help bring positive focus and contribution to North Shore Elementary, FNSE incorporated as a non-profit in December 2015 and was established as a 501&amp;copy;(3) a few months later.</description>

      <description>There is something incredibly rewarding about sending your child to the school next door. Friends, activites and events are nearby. You see the same faces, and grow to care for and respect your neighbors. Coincidentally, this has created an incredibly active group of parents and community members making up both the Parent and Teacher Association (PTA) and School Advisory Committee (SAC) who continue to support and challenge the school to be the best it can be.</description>

      <description>Friends of North Shore Elementary (FNSE) was founded from sidewalk conversations in 2015. Neighbors with preschool aged children were asking themselves,&amp;ldquo;Why are families in one neighborhood attending over 10 different elementary schools instead of North Shore Elementary, our zoned school?&amp;rdquo; The interest in this idea was incredibly strong, and it was clear that many individuals wanted to support their neighborhood school. With the purpose to help bring positive focus and contribution to North Shore Elementary, FNSE incorporated as a non-profit in December 2015 and was established as a 501&amp;copy;(3) a few months later.</description>

      <description>At the same time, the school grade is not all that prospective parents should care about. Gearing specifically towards tests does not ensure a well rounded education. Homework policies, teacher engagement, recess time and many other factors go into the North Shore experience. We strongly encourage all families who are considering North Shore elementary to schedule a tour and see first hand if the school meets their needs. Molly / Marci, are these two paragraphs the right feel?</description>

      <description>North Shore is also a uniquely small school with a total of 344 enrolled students. Some other public schools that parents consider have much larger enrollments such as: Perkins- 529 students, Jamerson- 560 students, and Bay Vista- 649 students. Our neighbors at Shore Acres, a strong neighborhood school, have 645 students, just to provide some context. We do believe that North Shore’s enrollment will grow in the next few years as more neighborhood families choose the school; however, we are a small physical campus with only so much room for growth.</description>

      <description>North Shore Elementary has been proudly serving students for over 90 years and is the alma mater to many of today’s leaders in St. Petersburg. It is a small school with character, compassion, diversity, and ingenuity that continues to define what successful public education should and can look like. With approximately 350 students (between 3 to 4 classes per grade) the small size of North Shore allows for all teachers and staff to know all students, not just the ones in their classes.</description>
