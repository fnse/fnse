      <description>North Shore is also a uniquely small school with a total of 344 enrolled students. Some other public schools that parents consider have much larger enrollments such as: Perkins- 529 students, Jamerson- 560 students, and Bay Vista- 649 students. Our neighbors at Shore Acres, a strong neighborhood school, have 645 students, just to provide some context. We do believe that North Shoreâ€™s enrollment will grow in the next few years as more neighborhood families choose the school; however, we are a small physical campus with only so much room for growth.</description>
