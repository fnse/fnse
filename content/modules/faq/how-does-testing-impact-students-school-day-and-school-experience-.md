We all know there is a reputation of testing overwhelming public schools and teachers, and taking away from creative learning.  There is a perception that in public schools all teachers do is teach to a test and that students are tested all the time.  At North Shore we do use dand assessments to help measure student learning but we do not let it define us.  All students in grades 1-5 take a MAP Assessment for in ELA (Language Arts) and Math three times a year (Fall, Winter, Spring).  Kindergarten takes just two MAP Assessments (Winter and Fall).  This assessment consists of an untimed computer based test that takes students around 30-60mins.  Additionally, grades 3 and 4 take a Science Assessment through MAP.  

In addition to these MAP Assessments grades 3 through 5 participate in the FSA testing.  This testing takes place in the spring and is controlled by the state (as far as testing windows etc.).  Typically, a student in grades 3-5 will be doing FSA testing for about 5 hours spanning 4 days. This includes two 80 minute sessions for each Math and ELA over a 2-day period. Grades 4 & 5 also take one 120 minute Writing Assessment.

Essentially, the MAPs are check-in tests along the way that the teachers use to assess where the students are and customize their learning, then the FSA is one annual standardized test.
