- question: What is the School Population and Diversity?
  answer: "North Shore is also a uniquely small school with a total of 344 enrolled students. Some other public schools that parents consider have much larger enrollments such as: Perkins 529 students, Jamerson 560 students, and Bay Vista 649 students.  Our neighbors at Shore Acres, a strong neighborhood school, have 645 students, just to provide some context. We do believe that North Shore’s enrollment will grow in the next few years as more neighborhood families choose the school; however, we are a small physical campus with only so much room for growth. Of our current 344 students, 248 are coming from within the geographic zone.

  Why are the 96 out-of-zone students at our school? The breakdown for these 96 students is as follows:  35 students enrolled in the ESE/ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) Program. We are proud of the robust ESE/ASD program at North Shore and its committed teachers and parents.33 Students are on Special Consideration (Special Assignment Request).23 Students from other categories (Teachers and Administration children with choice to attend North Shore; siblings of students with ESE (Exceptional Student Education) needs; address change students).3 Students are experiencing homelessness.2 Students are on McKay Scholarship (program for students with disabilities that provides families the opportunity to choose a private or public school that better fits the needs for their child). North Shore is also a uniquely diverse school and believes in the value that this diversity brings to all students.  It has been proven that diversity in the classroom contributes to increased learning in all children (Check out this article on the benefits of diverse learning environments https://tcf.org/content/report/how-racially-diverse-schools-and-classrooms-can-benefit-all-students) and we are proud of the diversity that we have at North Shore.  As of the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year students at North Shore were: 50.6% White, 27.6% Black, 13.9% Hispanic, 4.8% multi-racial, 2.6% Asian, and .6% Native American.  Additionally, 63.9% of students qualified for free and reduced lunch.  "
