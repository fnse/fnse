  role: Dad to Kindergartener and 3rd Grader
  body: Our son James entered North Shore in first grade and we couldn't be more excited.
    Having tried a private school, we find that there are a lot of advantages to attending
    a public school in our neighborhood. The proximity and ability to connect with
    other local families is important. We've found that North Shore has more resources
    to address the differing rates of learning in young children and the gifted and
    music programs were a major factor in choosing our neighborhood school. We look
    forward to watching James and his younger sister Anna grow at North Shore.
