  role: Parents to a 3rd grader
  body: We have been a North Shore Knights family for over 16 years, and have watched
    our neighborhood school grow and change. Teachers, administrators, and staff work
    closely with each other to make the school a supportive learning community. It
    is exciting to see our son come home eager to do his homework and participate
    in the school and PTA events. We are proud of the strides NSE has made toward
    inclusiveness and greater comprehensive educational opportunities. We are excited
    about North Shore’s continued service and success, and are proud to be part of
    it

- name: Jon Kile
  role: Dad to Kindergartener and 3rd Grader
  body: "\"Our son James entered North Shore in first grade and we couldn't be more
    excited. Having tried a private school, we find that there are a lot of advantages
    to attending a public school in our neighborhood. The proximity and ability to
    connect with other local families is important. We've found that North Shore has
    more resources to address the differing rates of learning in young children and
    the gifted and music programs were a major factor in choosing our neighborhood
    school. We look forward to watching James and his younger sister Anna grow at
    North Shore.”"
