- name: Vicki and Lee Koenig
  role: Parents of a Kindergartener
  body: Upon touring North Shore Elementary, we felt an immediate sense of community.  This
    feels like a small school with a staff who knows and cares about all of the kids.  After
    touring and comparing it with the choice school options, we decided to skip the
    lottery and register at NSE.  We have been so happy with that decision.  Our son
    is in a class of 17 kids and his teacher has time for all of them.  The faculty
    truly cares and supports all students.  His fellow students are our neighbors
    - we see them out at the park and around town.  He is not commuting to a distant
    school.  We have been especially impressed by seeing teachers and other staff
    members from the car circle to after care address our son by name and ask how
    he is doing as he transitions from preschool to elementary school.

- name: Jon Kile
  role: Dad to Kindergartener and 3rd Grader
  body: Our son James entered North Shore in first grade and we couldn't be more excited.
    Having tried a private school, we find that there are a lot of advantages to attending
    a public school in our neighborhood. The proximity and ability to connect with
    other local families is important. We've found that North Shore has more resources
    to address the differing rates of learning in young children and the gifted and
    music programs were a major factor in choosing our neighborhood school. We look
    forward to watching James and his younger sister Anna grow at North Shore.
