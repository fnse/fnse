At North Shore Elementary they have realized that not everything they want included in a school day fits into the 6 hour schedule.  Therefore they have worked hard to bring in programming as part of the “7th Hour” or before and after-school enrichment programs.  Currently there are 13 after school opportunities including: Dance, Drama, Band, Crazy 8’s, Challenge Island, Mad Science, STEM, TedEd, Girlfriends Club, Yoga, Soccer, Walking Club, and Spanish.  Some programs are free (costs covered by PTA) and some are fee for service with scholarships available for families.  The goal of the 7th hour is to enrich the students school day in a way that is accessible to all families and benefiting the entire North Shore Elementary community.
