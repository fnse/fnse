With the culture of the PTA being kind, inclusive, collaborative, trustworthy, available, and inspiring, general meetings are held every other month.  Additionally, there are a number of committee to get involved in, Fall Festival, Turkey Trot, Educational Garden, Families Socials, to name a few, it is an easy way to get connected to the school community and have a voice in how we can better educate students.  

In the coming year the PTA is looking to help support teachers and encourage participation in continuing education programs, provide scholarships and free opportunities for after school enrichments, as well as provide on-going program support for school-wide events like the One School One Book, Knight Readers, grade level field trips, and Bully Prevention.
