description: The PTAâ€™s vision is to foster a fully inclusive school community where
  students are thriving, teachers are supported, families are engaged, and all voices
  are welcome. Attending a PTA meeting, which take place every other month, is an
  easy way to get connected to the school community. Additionally, there are a number
  of committees to get involved in including Fall Festival, Turkey Trot, Garden, and
  Family Socials to name a few.
