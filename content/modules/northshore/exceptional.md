Currently North Shore Elementary is home to a robust Exceptional Student Education (ESE) Program, having full time ASD (4) and Gifted (1) teachers .  With one ASD unit per grade and 53 students enrolled in its Gifted Program North Shore is able to meet students where they are and challenge each of them in the right ways.  Students in the gifted program meet daily with the other students in their grade level and engage with an innovative project-based learning gifted curriculum under the guidance of the Gifted Teacher.  The ASD Program has approximately 1 unit or class per grade level and students are given targeted instruction and mainstream classroom time as is appropriate on an individual basis. North Shore is unique in both its ASD and Gifted Programs.  Unlike many other schools North Shore screens all incoming Kindergarteners for the gifted program, and then has identified students tested by the district.  By doing this the school eliminates teacher and parent bias when testing for the gifted program and is better able to serve all students.
