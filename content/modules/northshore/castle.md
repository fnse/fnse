C.A.P. is the acronym for the Castle Apprenticeship Program, previously called the “Schoolwide Enrichment Model” (SEM) that North Shore Elementary piloted in 2016. CAP is a research-based program out of the University of Connecticut that focuses on giving every child exposure to gifted curriculum and project based learning. This is an opportunity for all students to explore an area of interest in a nontraditional setting. CAP is traditionally experienced as an 8-week session.  Every Wednesday from 845AM – 945AM students report to a “cluster” that they have chosen based on their personal interests. Throughout this 8-week session, each cluster works on creating a final product that they will showcase for parents and families at the end of the session. This year our CAP showcase will be on the evening of December 21st.

Some examples of clusters our students have the opportunity to choose between are: World Travelers, Puppeteers Club, Fairy Tale Theater, Coding, Old School Games, Food Around the World, Gardening, Dance/Cheer, First Floridians, Making Music, Grandparent’s Club, Caped Crusaders, Pennies4Pets, STEM, Yoga, Team Sports, MakerSpace, Mural Painting/Mosaics, Citizen Scientists, Paper Weaving.
