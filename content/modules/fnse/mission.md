Our mission is to partner with North Shore Elementary in their work to ensure it is a dynamic, engaging and successful public school that proudly serves families in the Northeast region of St. Petersburg. We envision that North Shore Elementary is such a dynamic, engaging, and successful school that it is a key driver for families and businesses to locate to the area.
