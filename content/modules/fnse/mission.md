Our mission is to partner with North Shore Elementary in their work to ensure it is a dynamic, engaging and successful public school that proudly serves families in the Northeast region of St. Petersburg. We envision North Shore Elementary to be a valued community asset of the Northeast region of St. Petersburg, a key factor in attracting families and businesses to our region, and a point of pride and involvement for our neighborhoodâ€™s citizens regardless of whether they have children attending the school.
