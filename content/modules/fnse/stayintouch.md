Our primary means of communication is through our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/friendsofnorthshoreelementary/). Beyond that, we meet approximately once a month to discuss our roadmap. These meetings are open to all and usually take place at Panera on 4th St at 7:30pm  (exact dates and times are always posted on our Facebook Page). If you have any questions, please feel free to [contact us](#contact). You may also find relevant information on the [North Shore Elementary site](https://www.pcsb.org/northshore-es) or on their [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/NorthShoreElem).
