At Friends of North Shore, our goal is to identify needs of the school and offer our support to make sure those needs are met. From fundraising, networking, promotion to our time, we'll do what's necessary to ensure a successful experience for our children. If you're interested in helping out, please look at some ouf our needs below, and consider [contacting us](#). Even if a need is not listed on this site, but you have a specific skill to offer, we would love to hear from you. From all of us, thanks for your consideration.
