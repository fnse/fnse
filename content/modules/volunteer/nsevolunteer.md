There are plenty of ways to get involved at North Shore Elementary. We encourage all parents to attend our [PTA meetings](#) and share their thoughts. Additionally, community members are welcome to join the [Student Advisory Council](#) and lend their expertise. As for traditional volunteering, the school is actively looking for help in areas like mentoring, supervision, tutoring and front office assistance. To volunteer on campus, [you must fill out paperwork](https://www.pcsb.org/Page/21252) with Mrs. gervais which includes a background check. What adiditional info do we want to include here? Contact info, more detail on options, etc? You may find [additional opportunities on the school website](https://www.pcsb.org/domain/7787).
