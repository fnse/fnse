There are plenty of ways to get involved at North Shore Elementary. We encourage all parents to attend  [PTA meetings](#) and share their thoughts. Additionally, community members are welcome to join the [Student Advisory Council](#) and lend their expertise. As for traditional volunteering, the school is actively looking for help in areas like mentoring, lunch room supervision, tutoring and front office support. To volunteer on campus, [you must fill out paperwork](https://www.pcsb.org/Page/21252) with Mrs. Gervais, the Community Liaison which includes a background check. 

Please contact Ms. Valerie Gervais gervaisv@pcsb.org 727-893-2181 for more information about how to get involved directly with North Shore!
