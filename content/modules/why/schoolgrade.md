title: The School Grade

  North Shore Elementary as a <b>C</b></a>. We want to caution parents that the school
  grade is not a sufficient enough measure alone (in other words, it doesn't tell
  the true story of a school and all of its accomplishments and challenges).  North
  Shore proudly maintains a robust ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) program. They have
  approximately one unit (or class) per grade made up of students that qualify for
  ASD services.  These students are all tested the same as the rest of the student
  body.  Being a small school and having 12% of our student population qualifying
  as ASD students can and does impact our school grade.  Furthermore, the clear correlation
  between poverty and lower school grades throughout the Pinellas County School district
  illuminates that a measure of educational excellence cannot be solely determined
  by this current matrix.

The school grade cannot be all that prospective parents should care about. It is our belief that gearing specifically towards tests does not ensure a well rounded education for our kids. [Homework policies](#), [teacher engagement](#), [recess time](#), after-school enrichments, and many other factors go into the North Shore experience. We strongly encourage all families who are considering North Shore elementary to [schedule a tour](#) and see first hand how NSE meets the needs of all students.
