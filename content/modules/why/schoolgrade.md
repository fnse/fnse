title: The School Grade

  North Shore Elementary as a <b>B</b></a>. While the staff should be proud of the
  increase from last year, we want to caution parents that the school grade is not
  a sufficient enough measure alone. North Shore proudly maintains a robust ASD (Autism
  Spectrum Disorder) program. They have approximately one unit (or class) per grade
  made up of students that qualify for ASD services.  These students are all tested
  the same as the rest of the student body.  Being a small school and having 12% of
  our student population qualifying as ASD students can and does impact our school
  grade.

At the same time, the school grade is not all that prospective parents should care about. Gearing specifically towards tests does not ensure a well rounded education. [Homework policies](#), [teacher engagement](#), [recess time](#) and many other factors go into the North Shore experience. We strongly encourage all families who are considering North Shore elementary to [schedule a tour](#) and see first hand if the school meets their needs. Molly / Marci, are these two paragraphs the right feel? Discuss where we want to go with this.
