There has already been noticeable progress with the implementation of programs like [7th Hour/After School Enrichments](/nse#7<sup>th</sup>Hour) and opportunities for [Exceptional Student Education](/nse#ExceptionalStudentsEducation). Not to mention, a [ton of cool things](/nse#Highlights) are happening around campus. Then, add in [physical upgrades](/faq/#nse0), [FNSE boosting classrooms](/faq/#fnse3), and [professional development for teachers](/faq/#fnse2) and it becomes easy to see what an amazing school North Shore is and how many exciting things will continue to happen in the future!
