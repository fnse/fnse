There has already been noticeable progress with the implementation of programs like [7th Hour/After School Enrichments](/nse#7<sup>th</sup>Hour) and opportunities for [Exceptional Student Education](/nse#ExceptionalStudents). Not to mention, a [ton of cool things](/nse#Highlights) are happening around campus. Then, add in [physical upgrades](#), [FNSE boosting classrooms](#), and [professional development for teachers](#) and it becomes easy to see what an amazing school North Shore is and how many exciting things will continue to happen in the future!
