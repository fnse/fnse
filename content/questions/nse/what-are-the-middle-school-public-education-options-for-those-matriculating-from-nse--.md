There are many options for middle school that are available to Pinellas County Public School students and families like those who attend North Shore Elementary.  The two current feeder middle schools based on geography are John Hopkins Middle School and Meadowlawn Middle School.  In additional to a regular day, John Hopkins offers 2 additional programs that students may apply for as incoming 6th graders:

* International Baccalaureate (IB Program)
* An award-winning Center for International Studies in the Arts and Multimedia Journalism Magnet Program.

Additionally, there are a variety of district application programs available for middle school families such as:

* Thurgood Marshall Fundamental Middle School (has a gifted program component)
* Sanderlin (currently a K-8 school with and International Studies focus)
* Madeira Beach Fundamental Middle School
* Bay Point Middle School

The district is also currently in discussion with the YMCA to potentially build a new middle school at the former Riviera Middle School site that could be open as early as 2021.

As with the selection of elementary schools, there are, and will be, numerous choices available for your child within Pinellas County Public School System that will build upon the wonderful educational foundation provided at North Shore Elementary.
