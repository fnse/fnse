There are a number of different options for Before and After-Care at North Shore.  On-site there is the YMCA program that is open from 6:30am-6pm for parents and families.  This program provides breakfast as well as a substantial snack after the school day, and is made up of homework and academic support, as well as extra-curricular activities.  Additionally, the iClass 21st Century Learning Program is a free option for 3rd, 4th and 5th Graders that supports academic learning as well as provides extra-curricular and enrichment opportunities for students.  Finally, the Police Athletic League (PAL), Shore Acres Rec Center, and the Tim McCahan After-School Sports Program all provide a bus pick-up and after-care opportunities for North Shore families.
