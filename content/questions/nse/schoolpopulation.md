> North Shore is also a uniquely small school with a total of 412 enrolled students. Some other public schools that parents consider have much larger enrollments such as: Perkins- 529 students, Jamerson- 560 students, and Bay Vista- 649 students. Our neighbors at Shore Acres, a strong neighborhood school, have 645 students, just to provide some context. We do believe that North Shoreâ€™s enrollment will grow in the next few years as more neighborhood families choose the school; however, we are a small physical campus with only so much room for growth.

> North Shore is also a uniquely diverse school and believes in the value that this diversity brings to all students. It has been proven that diversity in the classroom contributes to increased learning in all children ( [Check out this article on the benefits of diverse learning environments](https://tcf.org/content/report/how-racially-diverse-schools-and-classrooms-can-benefit-all-students)) and we are proud of the diversity that we have at North Shore. As of the beginning of the 2019-2020 school year students at North Shore were: 58% White, 26% Black, 13% Hispanic, 2% Asian, and 1% Native American. Additionally, 61% of students qualified for free and reduced lunch.
