North Shore is also a uniquely diverse school and believes in the value that this diversity brings to all students. It has been proven that diversity in the classroom contributes to increased learning in all children ( [Check out this article on the benefits of diverse learning environments](https://tcf.org/content/report/how-racially-diverse-schools-and-classrooms-can-benefit-all-students)) and we are proud of the diversity that we have at North Shore. As of the beginning of the 2019-2020 school year students at North Shore were: 58% White, 26% Black, 13% Hispanic, 2% Asian, and 1% Native American. Additionally, 61% of students qualified for free and reduced lunch.
