title = "North Shore Elementary is a currently a C school, and in recent history a D school. How is it a good school with a low school grade?"

+++
The school grades are based purely on one standardized test given by the state each spring. In elementary school only scores from 3rd, 4th and 5th graders are included in the school grade. There are eight “components” to the elementary school grade. Four of those components are the average of scores in: 1) English Language Arts, 2) Mathematics, 3) Science and 4) Social Studies. The other four components are an expression of learning gains. Two of these four are learning gains for all students, and two of them are learning gains in the bottom performing 25%. Each of these eight components are equally weighted in determining the school grade.  It is important to note that all students are tested with no exceptions.  

At North Shore, we are proud of our robust ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) program. We have approximately one unit (or class) per grade made up of students that qualify for ASD services.  These students are all tested the same as the rest of the student body.  Being a small school and having 12% of our student population qualifying as ASD students can and does impact our school grade.  

A school like North Shore may have 25-40% of their students consistently make 4s or 5s on the state test (5 is the highest grade, 1 is the lowest), and 25% consistently make 1s or 2s due to factors outside of the teachers sphere of influence. This is a normal distribution of capability which vacillates depending on a school’s socio-economic diversity and inclusion of autistic or exceptional students.
