+++
North Shore Elementary has full-time art, music, and PE teachers.  All students have Art and Music once a week and PE 3-times a week.  Additionally, recess is provided daily (for 20mins) and supervised by the classroom teacher.  All teachers are given a bag of recess supplies (balls, hula hoops, chalk etc.) at the beginning of the year to help facilitate fun free play outside.
