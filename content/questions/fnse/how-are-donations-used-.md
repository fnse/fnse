All donations to FNSE go directly back into the students, school, teachers and faculty.  Currently we are aiming to raise another $6000 to finish our Boost Program, providing funds for Art, Music, PE and Media Center teachers to spruce up their classrooms.  We also like to have funds on hand to support professional development for teachers and field trip support.
